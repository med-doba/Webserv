sometimes accept fails and the program exits find out why it fails
fix if a client disconnect in the recv and the index gets checked for pollout


fix get method with body should return a bad request
if a request get sent with a get method and has transfer-encoding or Content-Length or Content-Type
should return bad request
it's okay with Content-Length aslong as the value is zero




to handle errors in the request create a response class that 
a status code and phrase that explaines the error and function
that generate the request depending on the status code and the phrase 
this way it becomes easier and more portable solution the errors
handling i should incoprate this in the normal response as well



=> handle if a header doesn't have a value only if that header is nessecary
to the request method (pending ...)

=> handle chanked transfer if size of buffer bigger than the contentlength in the headers (done)

=> handle delete required headers (pending ...)

=> handle boundary contentLength == 0 (done)


=>	415 Unsupported Media Type
This response means that the server was unable to process the request because the content type
specified in the Content-Type header is not supported by the server. (pending ...)

=> handle that it goes into nonchunked when it's a delete method (done)

=> ask mustapha if he handled nothing but space between the elements of the request line (pending ...)


Sure, here are some headers that should not be included in certain HTTP methods:

Content-Length: This header should not be included in GET requests, as GET requests do not have a request body. If a GET request includes a Content-Length header, you should respond with a "400 Bad Request" error.

Transfer-Encoding: This header should not be included in GET requests, as GET requests do not have a request body. If a GET request includes a Transfer-Encoding header, you should respond with a "400 Bad Request" error.

Host: This header is required for all HTTP requests, so if it is not included in the request, you should respond with a "400 Bad Request" error.

Content-Type: This header should be included in POST requests, as the request body may contain data in various formats. If this header is not included in a POST request, you should respond with a "400 Bad Request" error.

Authorization: This header should be included in requests that require authentication. If it is not included and authentication is required, you should respond with a "401 Unauthorized" error.

Range: This header should not be included in POST or DELETE requests, as those methods do not retrieve partial content of a resource. If it is included in a POST or DELETE request, you should respond with a "400 Bad Request" error.
If-Modified-Since: This header should not be included in POST or DELETE requests, as those methods do not modify resources based on a specific timestamp. If it is included in a POST or DELETE request, you should respond with a "400 Bad Request" error.


Note that these are just some examples, and the exact headers that are allowed or disallowed for a particular HTTP method may vary depending on the server implementation or specific use case.






Here are some of the necessary headers and behaviors for the three HTTP methods GET, POST, and DELETE:

GET method

Required headers: Host
Optional headers: If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Match, Range
Response for missing Host: 400 Bad Request
POST method

Required headers: Host, Content-Type, Content-Length
Optional headers: If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Match
Response for missing Host: 400 Bad Request
Response for missing Content-Type: 400 Bad Request
Response for missing Content-Length: 411 Length Required
DELETE method

Required headers: Host
Optional headers: If-Match, If-Unmodified-Since
Response for missing Host: 400 Bad Request
Note that there may be additional headers required or optional for specific use cases, but these are some of the most common ones.

For missing required headers, the server should respond with a 400 Bad Request status code. For optional headers, the server should still process the request even if the header is missing.

Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF


The Method  token indicates the method to be performed on the
resource identified by the Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive.

	Method         = "OPTIONS"                ; Section 9.2
					| "GET"                    ; Section 9.3
					| "HEAD"                   ; Section 9.4
					| "POST"                   ; Section 9.5
					| "PUT"                    ; Section 9.6
					| "DELETE"                 ; Section 9.7
					| "TRACE"                  ; Section 9.8
					| "CONNECT"                ; Section 9.9
					| extension-method
	extension-method = token

	   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   Allow header field (section 14.7). The return code of the response
   always notifies the client whether a method is currently allowed on a
   resource, since the set of allowed methods can change dynamically. An
   origin server SHOULD return the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET
   and HEAD MUST be supported by all general-purpose servers. All other
   methods are OPTIONAL; however, if the above methods are implemented,
   they MUST be implemented with the same semantics as those specified
   in section 9.

   The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting
   of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its
   associated textual phrase, with each element separated by SP
   characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.

       Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF

status-code 

      - 1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process

      - 2xx: Success - The action was successfully received,
        understood, and accepted

      - 3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to
        complete the request

      - 4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot
        be fulfilled

      - 5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently
        valid request
